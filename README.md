# PRET Android GUI
An android port, and GUI, for [PRET - Printer Exploitation Toolkit](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET), a tool written in python for printer security testing and exploitation. The app itself is written in Kotlin, but PRET stays in python. Termux is used to install the nescessary python modules, and to run the python code, however i would like to eventually remove this as a dependency.

**Currently this application is NOT functional. Only the very beginnings of the UI are done, and it is likely this app will never be finished.**

## Building
To build, simply clone the repo and build with Android Studio.

## Usage
This section will be updated when/if the app becomes usable. In the meantime, [here](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET#usage) is some general usage info for PRET.

## Compatibility
Should work on Android versions 6.0 to 10.0 and up (though it should be pretty easy to get it running with lower versions). It has only been tested with android 9.0 and 10.0 however.
